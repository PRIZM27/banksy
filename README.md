## What does Banksy do?
Account login, track deposits and withdrawals, transfer money between accounts, request a loan, and close an account

## Login to an account
Users can login to one of four accounts. To view specific bank account information, enter anyone of the following username/pin combos in the login fields:
<username><pin> *all lowercase for username*
1. js 1111
2. jd 2222
3. stw 3333
4. ss 4444

Banksy does not actually issue authentication tokens or manage sessions, it just checks to see if the input values for username and pin match a certain criteria

##Enjoy!
